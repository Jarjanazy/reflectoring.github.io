It's the time of the year again to look back at what I have achieved in the last year and to look forward to what I want to achieve in the upcoming year. 

This account is more for myself than anyone else, but if you're interested in some numbers around the blog and my side business, there may be some interesting nuggets for you in this post.

Let's start...

## The Blog - reflectoring.io

The blog you're just now reading is the center of my online activities. I started to write publicly in 2018, and every year I took it a bit more serious. 

Turns out that being serious about something pays out.

Last year I had about 600,000 unique users on my website (as Google Analytics counts them). This year, **I almost doubled it to 1.1 million unique users**:

But, that growth in traffic didn't come from me alone. I had a little help by Google whose algorithm change caused a considerable bump upwards in May. But Google decided to withdraw their help again in December with an equally sized bump downwards. 

But more importantly, I've had help by a bunch of great authors who published articles on reflectoring. In 2020, the step to take my blog more serious was to open up the blog for contributing authors, with me editing their texts to get them up to reflectoring standards. The serious part in this is that I pay the authors to write on the blog, so I'm betting real money that this will pay out in the long run.

With the help of my authors, I doubled the number of blog posts from about 30 in 2019 to 60 in 2020! Of these 60, I only wrote 21 myself. The other 39 were written by contributing authors. **I paid $3,700 in total to these authors**. 2020 has been the first year that I'm investing serious money into this blog.

At this point I want to thank all the authors that have published articles on reflectoring. The main reason for starting the blog was for me to learn new stuff and reading all your articles increases my pace of learning considerably. Thank you for working with me! I'm looking forward to continue working with you in 2021!

If you're interested in writing on reflectoring, check out the ["Write With Me"](/write-with-me/) page.

Another thing where I've been more serious is my mailing list. I've been consistently sending a weekly update with a link to the newest article to my mailing list with currently 2,300 subscribers, which has grown by about 1,000 subscribers in 2020.

I have a feeling that the subscription rate of the newsletter could be a lot higher with the traffic that my blog is generating. That's probably because the hurdle of paying $5 for the welcome gift (my book) is quite high. But I'm rewarded with a very engaged audience with mail opening rates of about 40%, so I think that's fine.

## Book #1 - Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture

I wouldn't have invested a couple thousand dollars into paying authors if I didn't earn that money somehow. My book ["Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture"](/book/) is what made this possible.

I finished the book in late 2019, and it's been generating some steady income since then, which I decided to re-invest into growing the blog by paying authors. 

In 2020, I've made about $13,000 with this book, which is way more than I would ever have thought possible without having a giant audience beforehand. 

But the book was received well and has gotten some great reviews on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49238827-get-your-hands-dirty-on-clean-architecture) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1839211962/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1839211962&linkCode=as2&tag=reflectorin0c-20&linkId=559e54b6599c4213252259df28d1d3e3). I put a lot of effort in it, so I'm happy how this turned out.

## The SaaS - blogtrack.io

One of my goals for 2020 was to create a SaaS application for bloggers. I've been frustrated with Google Analytics for a while and wanted to build something that gives me concrete and actionable insights into what I can improve in my blog (without having to read multiple tutorials and do a course on how to use Google Analytics).

Since I'm not the only one with a blog, I decided to start building an Blog analytics app with myself as the first user, but building it in a way that I can sell it to other bloggers later. This turned out to be [blogtrack.io](https://blogtrack.io), but it's not quite ready for the public yet.

I wanted to learn while building it, so I built it in a way that I would build a real application, with a modular architecture and a robust deployment on AWS. 

So, I dove into AWS in depth to learn how to best deploy the app, combining the new knowledge with the knowledge I already had from my work at Atlassian.

At some point, I started a conversation with Philip Riecks and Björn Wilmsmann about blogging in general and we decided to write a book about AWS - "Stratospheric". 

Blogtrack is not generating any income, yet, and the AWS bill is around $100 a month, but a book doesn't write itself, so I had to stop my work on it. But I'm happy with the result so far nevertheless. I'm using it for myself and my authors are using it to see their stats. And I plan to continue work on it in earnest in 2021.

## Book #2 - Stratospheric

As mentioned above, I'm currently writing a book called ["Stratospheric"](https://stratospheric.dev) about deploying Spring Boot apps on AWS. It's for Spring developers who are not familiar with AWS, yet. We're about 30% done and I'm guessing we'll have a final version ready some time around April 2021 or so.

The book is already available [on Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/stratospheric) and we're adding new chapters as we finish them. We already have 200 paying readers, which is very encouraging. I'm happy how the book is turning out and looking forward to getting it over the finish line in early 2021, so I can focus on blogtrack once more.  

## Review of My Goals for 2020

2020 has certainly been disrupting for all of us, with working from home the new normal for knowledge workers. It has certainly made it possible for me to invest more time into some of my goals for 2020.

Let's see which of my [goals for 2020](/review-2019/#plans-for-2020) I could scratch off my list:

* **I wanted to read (at least) 15 nonfiction books from cover to cover:** check. I've read something north of 20 books last year. I'm reading 20-30 minutes every lunch break and I want to keep it this way. Books are what inspires me.
* **I wanted to prepare a fun talk connecting psychology and habits with software development:** meh. No new talk this year. With everything going on in 2020 (in the world and personally), I couldn't muster the creativity to come up with something.
* **I wanted to start (and perhaps even finish?), another writing project:** check. I've started writing "Stratospheric" and it's even already available on Leanpub in a preview version. Working on it with two co-authors definitely helps to deliver on promises!
* **I wanted to speak at 3 or more conferences or meetups:** meh. Not much conferencing this year. I had a talk accepted to the Spring I/O conference in Barcelona but the virus had other plans. I also had submitted some talks to other conferences, but my creativity was elsewhere last year, so they weren't accepted. I spoke at a Java User Group meetup about Clean Architecture, though.
* **I wanted to double the visitors to my blog by working together with other authors and editing their work**: check. Only through my authors could I increase the visitors to my blog.
* **I want to build a habit of working out to get my neglected body into shape:** check. My body is still not what I would call "in shape", but I have built a steady habit of walking and/or running every day. I'm consiously shaping those habits so I have a good feeling about the next year. 
* **I definitely wanted to take surfing lessons while I’m in Sydney:** meh. I didn't take the time for surfing lessons. I need to get out more!

## Goals for 2021

Here's what I have planned for 2021:

* I want to get my back in order. My back and ribs didn't enjoy the "work from home" change caused by the virus and I have to get professional help to make it better.
* I want to go up one level of seriousness and invest a full day each week in my online activities of blogging, writing, and building a SaaS. I have to find a source for that day.
* With that investment of time, I want to reach a monthly passive income of $3,000 in 2021.
* I want to read even more books than in 2020! 20 books at least!
