## TL;DR: Read this Book, when...

* you're a manager, you don't know much about software development and want to learn about agile software development
* you haven't worked in an agile manner before and want to know the key methods
* you *have* worked in an agile manner before and want some re-affirmation that you're doing the right thing

## Book Facts

* **Title:** The Nature of Software Development
* **Author:** Ron Jeffries
* **Word Count:** ~ 20.000 (1.5 hours at 250 words / minute)
* **Reading Ease:** easy
* **Writing Style:** grandfatherly advice (in a good way)  

## Overview

{% include book-link.html book="nature-of-software-develoment" %} by Ron Jeffries is an opinionated piece about agile software development. Jeffries, as one of the founders of the Agile Manifesto, sees Agile as the "natural way" of creating software, the way with the least resistance towards getting good results.

The book is very short. It's even shorter than the 150 pages suggest, as many pages contain a doodle visualizing the current topic. Even then, many pages have a lot of white space, so don't expect an epic tale.

Instead, the book goes over all important topics of software development on a very high level. You won't get any specific advice on developing software, but you'll get advice that might help high-level managers to appreciate the benefits of agile software development.

## Notes

Here are my notes, as usual with some comments in *italics*.

### Value
* software development must be driven by value
* value is only delivered by shipping features
* prioritize cheap features with high value

### Feature by Feature
* activity-based planning is "all-or-nothing" - it's hard to change things in later phases
* instead, deliver feature by feature
  * earlier results
  * more information to steer the project
  * more flexible to changing requirements
  
### Feature Teams
* organize teams so that a feature doesn't have to be handed over between teams (*I would add that teams should have clear code ownership of software components wherever possible and should only share code ownership of components if not otherwise possible*)
* create cross-team communities of practice to share expertise in certain disciplines

### Planning
* identify high-value features and plan them - defer low-value features
* set a time and money budget instead of a feature scope
* do the important stuff first
* the team works in intervals, taking as much work into each interval as they think they can do
* estimation is risky - we spend time trying to improve estimations and compare them to other estimates
* "Pressure is destructive. Avoid it."
* "Estimates are likely to be wrong, and they focus our attention on the cost of things rather than on value."

## Conclusion

As a software developer that has done agile projects, you won't get much out of this book for yourself. But you might learn a couple argument for agile practices that you can use to defend your software development style against un-agile managers.
