## Overview

{% include book-link.html book="hell-yeah" %} is a very succinctly written book about some lessons the author made in his life and thought worth sharing.

It's a collection of very short chapters of 1-5 pages. Each chapter was once a blog post that contains one lesson about life. It's basically a window into the philosophy of Derek Sivers, a maker and entrepreneur.

It's about things like finding your identity, making things happen, saying yes and no, and finding out what's worth doing.

## Notes

Here are my notes, as usual with some comments in *italics*.

### Updating Identity

* what's left if you stopped doing everything you did for money and attention? (*i.e. don't let your work life define you - I guess "reading books" would still be on my list*)
* your actions reveal your values
* if you think you want something but haven't started yet, either stop lying to yourself that you want it or start doing it to see if you really want it
* "Success comes from doing, not declaring."
* if you don't keep doing the same job, you shouldn't keep the same job title - we shouldn't pretend to be something we aren't anymore
* make sure to know what you value most so you can align your decisions with your goals and values - always be able to answer why you're doing things
* no matter what your preferences are, someone will always say you're wrong - know your preferences to orient yourse
